Using 4 seperate functions I created a triangle, an ellipse, a custom shape using vertex's and a sprite. Each were drawn using variables 
and colored with RGB. 
The triangle was made with the function "drawTriangle." The ellipse with "drawEllipse." The custom shape with "drawHeart." The sprite was "drawSprite."
The sprite also has an if else statement where if the mouse is pressed the sprite will change to a new sprite.
